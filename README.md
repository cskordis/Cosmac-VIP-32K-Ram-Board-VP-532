# Cosmac-VIP-32K-Ram-Board-VP-532
A new 32K ram board for the Cosmac VIP called the VP532, comprises of a 62256 Ram chip, a 74HC373 address latch, 4072 3 input OR gate and 4011 NAND gate 

The logic on the board, thanks to Raymond Jett, allows the on board ram to function from 0000H - 0FFFH and only allow the 32K from 1000H.
The board had been tested successfully with the VP700 Tiny Basic board where a Print MEM gives a whopping 27893 bytes free. 

It has also been tested with the VP550 Super Sound card playing multiple and continuously music.
